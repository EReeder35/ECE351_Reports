\section{Procedure}

This lab covered the basic setup and installation of the Spyder IDE for Python onto a computer, including downloading the necessary libraries for this lab. Additionally, it walked through the steps in setting up a GitHub, which is linked at the bottom of this report.

\section{Questions}

What did you do over last summer, or what are you planning to do this upcoming summer?

Last summer I managed a ranch near Sandpoint, ID. While that was a fun summer and I learned a lot, this summer, I hope to get an internship in Boise, ID at Micron Technologies to advance my career.

What do you personally want to get out of this lab?

I personally want to be able to advance my knowledge of Python and my ability to use it in a practical setting.
